1) First things first, I’ve gotta figure out how long and wide the bridge is so it’s off to wikipedia which tells me the bridge is 8981 feet long and 90 feet wide multiplying both by 12 to figure out the dimensions in inches 107,772 long and 1080 wide. Now to figure out the diameter of a penny. A quick google search turns up the US mint telling me they’re about .75 inches in diameter. Next I divide the width in inches, 1080, by the diameter of a penny, .75, to end up with 1440 (width in pennies) followed by the same calculation for length gives us 143,696. Multiply these together to get a total of 206,922,240. To ensure this was an accurate count I measured a standard sheet of paper in pennies and came up with 166 pennies to cover it. This fails to take into account are covered up by the cables and the two towers that hold the cables up but unfortunately I was unable to find the area of those. The closest I could come was the diameter of one cable measuring 36.5 inches

3) What is the minimum number of moves required for a knight to cover the entire chess board? Write a program to prove it. Provide a graph with the move number on the x axis and the number of squares covered on the y axis.

The minimum number of moves for a Knight to get across a chessboard is equal to the number of squares on a chessboard. Typically chessboards are 8 x 8 so the Knight should be able to get across in 63 moves.
