Hello IGN,

I’ve been doing front end web development seriously for the last 3 years since I started taking classes at Portland Community College. Since then I have created a few websites: normgrock.com, fitstudios.net, 4pointplay.net, onceuponasketch.com along with a few others. In addition to developing websites I had been crafting HTML emails for childcaremarketplace.com before they went out of business earlier this year. When I’m not developing websites or emails I’m usually reading web design books, playing video games, playing basketball or out and about with friends. I’ve been an IGN fan since I found IGN64 so many years back. Check out the above websites and my portfolio site, paulgrock.com, and my answers to the challenge questions. Keep up the good work.
